## Working with the AI workbench

This project is operated with skills from the AI workbench. Before starting any task:

1. Read `docs/workbench/state.md`: current flow and phase, autonomy mode, registered artifacts, approvals, open questions.
2. When a request could match several skills or spans several areas, run the orchestrator skill first and follow its route.
3. Artifacts live under `docs/<area>/`. Rows marked `existing` in the state file point to documents kept elsewhere in this repository; treat them as the artifact they are registered as, in place.
4. Actions outside this repository (publish, send, deploy, create tickets) need one explicit approval of the exact payload, recorded in the state file. Once approved, proceed without asking again; re-ask only for what changed.
5. Autonomy: checkpoints mode is `every-phase`. Confirmation gates and blocking open questions stop a flow in every mode.
6. Artifacts are written in English unless this file says otherwise. Reply to the user in their language.
