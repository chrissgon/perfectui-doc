# UX flows: perfectui documentation site, phase P-1

- Owner: design-ux-flows
- Status: draft
- Date: 2026-09-23
- PRD: docs/product/prd.md
- Phase covered: P-1 (release R-1, the 1.0 launch); the version switch of P-2 is included where it shapes the information architecture

## Summary

Nineteen nodes, six screens and seven flows. At the 1.0 launch an evaluator lands, understands the library, reads its measured size, copies the install command and reads a component page with live examples; a migrating user reaches the migration guide in one click; every reader searches the version being read and switches mode and theme colour. Copy, colours and layout are not decided here.

## Screens

- SCREEN-1: Landing. Purpose: let an evaluator understand perfectui, trust its size, install it and enter the documentation in one screen. Regions: value proposition (sentence and paragraph, texts from the messaging step), install command with copy control, primary call to action to `/docs`, size block with version and method, components showcase (at least 4 live examples), migration call to action, further sections from the messaging step, footer. States: default; copied (copy control feedback for at least 1 second); no JavaScript (copy control, mode and theme controls absent or inert); reduced motion (no animation). Breakpoints: on a 360 px wide screen the value proposition, the install command and the primary call to action stay inside the first viewport and the showcase stacks in one column. Source: landing spec REQ-1 to REQ-6, NFR-3, EDGE-1 to EDGE-3; PRD F-3; state decision (messaging step).
- SCREEN-2: Documentation page. Purpose: read one page of one version with its examples and move to any other page of that version. Regions: page header (title, description, since or changed badge), content with example blocks (preview tab, code tab, copy), sidebar navigation of the version (sections in prefix order, current page marked), on-page headings list, previous and next page links. States: default; page with badges; page without headings (no on-page list); narrow (sidebar collapsed behind a control). Breakpoints: below the tablet width the sidebar becomes a toggleable panel and the on-page headings list collapses into the content. Source: content-model spec REQ-1 to REQ-4, REQ-7; PRD F-1, F-2, F-12; codebase map (docs layout with sidebar as baseline).
- SCREEN-3: Site shell. Purpose: give every page the same header and footer with navigation, version label, external links, mode toggle, theme picker and the search entry point. Regions: header (logo with latest version label, docs link, search entry point, version switch slot, mode toggle, theme picker, GitHub and Figma links), footer (license, repository link). States: default; light and dark (from `data-pui-mode`); theme colour applied; search entry point absent when the build has no search. Breakpoints: below the tablet width the header keeps logo, search and mode toggle visible and moves the rest behind a menu control. Source: landing spec REQ-6 to REQ-9; search spec REQ-1; content-model spec REQ-5; state decision (Figma link kept).
- SCREEN-4: Search dialog. Purpose: find a page or section of the version being read as the reader types. Regions: input (focused on open), results list (page title, section heading, highlighted snippet, selected item marked), footer with the keyboard hints, close control. States: empty (input only); results; no results ("No results for <query>"); unavailable (index failed to load, with retry); loading the index on first open. Breakpoints: full-screen on narrow screens; centered dialog otherwise. Source: search spec REQ-1 to REQ-3, REQ-7, REQ-8, EDGE-2, EDGE-3.
- SCREEN-5: Version index with switch notice. Purpose: land a reader who switched to a version where the current page does not exist, and serve as each version's index. Regions: notice naming the page and the version in which it does not exist (only after a failed switch), version title and older-version mark when not latest, list of sections and pages of the version. States: index without notice; index with notice. Breakpoints: single column on narrow screens. Source: content-model spec REQ-6, EDGE-1; PRD F-6, F-7 (P-2; designed with P-1 so the shell reserves its slot).
- SCREEN-6: Migration guide page. Purpose: let a 0.23 user follow the migration inside the site. Regions: page header with the version range ("applies to 0.23.0 → <installed version>"), section list of the guide (Why, 1 to 8, Known trade-offs) as an on-page index, content with mapping tables and diff blocks, sidebar navigation. States: default; tables scrolling inside their box on narrow screens; 0.23 names as links (v0 present) or plain text (v0 absent). Breakpoints: same as SCREEN-2; tables scroll horizontally inside their box at 360 px. Source: migration-guide spec REQ-2 to REQ-5, NFR-1, EDGE-1, EDGE-2, EDGE-5.

## Flows

- FLOW-1: Evaluate and install. Actor: U-1. Trigger: the evaluator opens `/` from a search engine or a link. Steps: 1. on SCREEN-1: read the value proposition → knows what perfectui is; 2. on SCREEN-1: read the size block → sees the gzip numbers, the version and the method; 3. on SCREEN-1: scroll the showcase → sees at least 4 live components; 4. on SCREEN-1: activate the copy control → the command is in the clipboard and the control reads "copied"; 5. on SCREEN-1: activate the primary call to action → SCREEN-2 opens at the documentation index or first page. End: the evaluator is on a documentation page with the install command copied. Failures: step 4 without clipboard access (EDGE-9 of the landing spec): the command is shown selected for manual copy; step 4 without JavaScript: the control is absent and the command is still readable. Keyboard: Tab to the copy control, Enter; Tab to the primary call to action, Enter. Source: PRD F-3, U-1; landing spec REQ-1 to REQ-5, EDGE-9.
- FLOW-2: Read a component page and use an example. Actor: U-1. Trigger: the reader is on SCREEN-2 or arrives at a page URL. Steps: 1. on SCREEN-2: pick a page in the sidebar → the page opens, the sidebar marks it; 2. on SCREEN-2: read the header → sees the title, description and an "Added in" or "Changed in" badge when present; 3. on SCREEN-2: switch an example block to its code tab → the highlighted snippet is shown; 4. on SCREEN-2: copy the snippet → clipboard holds the example; 5. on SCREEN-2: use the on-page headings list → the page scrolls to the section. End: the reader has the snippet and knows where the section is. Failures: step 1 on a narrow screen: the sidebar is behind a control that must be opened first; step 4 without clipboard access: the code is shown selected. Keyboard: Tab through the sidebar links, Enter; Tab to the example tabs, Arrow keys switch tabs, Tab to copy, Enter. Source: PRD F-1, F-2, F-12; content-model spec REQ-3, REQ-4, REQ-7.
- FLOW-3: Search the version being read. Actor: U-1. Trigger: the reader presses `/` outside a text field or activates the search entry point on SCREEN-3. Steps: 1. on SCREEN-3: activate search → SCREEN-4 opens with the input focused, the index loads on first open; 2. on SCREEN-4: type `moda` → results appear as typed, restricted to the version being read; 3. on SCREEN-4: move the selection → the selected result is marked and announced; 4. on SCREEN-4: activate a result → SCREEN-2 opens scrolled to the matching section. End: the reader is on the matching section. Failures: step 2 with no match: "No results for <query>"; step 1 when the index fails to load: "Search is unavailable" with retry; step 1 without JavaScript: no entry point, the sidebar remains the way to find pages. Keyboard: `/`, type, ArrowDown, Enter; Escape closes and returns focus to the entry point. Source: PRD F-5; search spec REQ-1 to REQ-4, REQ-7, REQ-8, EDGE-1, EDGE-2.
- FLOW-4: Migrate from 0.23. Actor: U-2. Trigger: a 0.23 user opens `/` or a documentation page. Steps: 1. on SCREEN-1: activate the migration call to action → SCREEN-6 opens; 2. on SCREEN-6: read the version range in the header → knows which versions the guide covers; 3. on SCREEN-6: use the section index → jumps to "4. Components"; 4. on SCREEN-6: read the mapping table → finds the 1.0 class for a 0.23 class; 5. on SCREEN-6: follow a 0.23 name link (when v0 exists) → the v0 page opens on SCREEN-2 under `/docs/v0/`. End: the user knows the replacement and, in P-2, can read the old page. Failures: step 5 in P-1 (no v0): the name is plain text, no dead link; step 4 on a narrow screen: the table scrolls inside its box. Keyboard: Tab to the migration call to action, Enter; Tab through the section index, Enter; Tab to a table link, Enter. Source: PRD F-4, U-2; migration-guide spec REQ-2 to REQ-6, EDGE-1, EDGE-2, EDGE-5; landing spec REQ-4.
- FLOW-5: Switch version (P-2, shapes the P-1 shell). Actor: U-2. Trigger: the reader opens the version switch control on SCREEN-3. Steps: 1. on SCREEN-3: choose v0 → if the same path exists in v0, SCREEN-2 opens at `/docs/v0/<same path>`; 2. on SCREEN-2: read the older-version mark → knows this is 0.23; 3. on SCREEN-3: choose the latest → SCREEN-2 opens at `/docs/<same path>`. End: the reader is on the same page in the chosen version. Failures: step 1 when the page does not exist in v0: SCREEN-5 opens with the notice naming the page and the version; step 1 with the search dialog open: results re-filter to the new version. Keyboard: Tab to the switch control, Enter, ArrowDown to a version, Enter. Source: PRD F-6, F-7; content-model spec REQ-6, EDGE-1; search spec EDGE-5.
- FLOW-6: Change mode and theme colour. Actor: U-1. Trigger: the reader activates the mode toggle or the theme picker on SCREEN-3. Steps: 1. on SCREEN-3: activate the mode toggle → `data-pui-mode` changes and every component and example follows; 2. on SCREEN-3: pick a colour in the theme picker → `--pui-theme` changes and every component and example follows without reload; 3. on SCREEN-2: reload → the mode persists (cookie) and the colour persists for the session. End: the site shows the chosen mode and colour. Failures: no stored mode: the site follows the operating system; step 2 with a low-contrast colour: applied anyway, the site's own text is unaffected. Keyboard: Tab to the toggle, Enter; Tab to the picker, Enter opens the native colour input. Source: PRD F-8; landing spec REQ-8, REQ-9, EDGE-4 to EDGE-6.
- FLOW-7: Arrive at a missing or moved page. Actor: U-1. Trigger: the reader opens an unknown URL. Steps: 1. on SCREEN-5: read the not-found message → sees the link to the latest index and the search entry point; 2. on SCREEN-3: search or navigate → SCREEN-2 opens. End: the reader reaches a page of the latest version. Failures: none beyond the not-found state itself. Keyboard: Tab to the index link, Enter. Source: ASSUMPTION-2; content-model spec REQ-1.

## Coverage

- F-1: FLOW-2, SCREEN-2
- F-2: FLOW-2, SCREEN-2
- F-3: FLOW-1, SCREEN-1
- F-4: FLOW-4, SCREEN-6
- F-5: FLOW-3, SCREEN-4
- F-8: FLOW-6, SCREEN-3
- F-9: no screen: page metadata is produced by the build (landing spec REQ-10), not shown in a screen
- F-10: no screen: authoring happens in the repository (content-model spec NFR-1), not in the site
- F-12: FLOW-2, SCREEN-2

## Assumptions

- ASSUMPTION-1: The site-specific sections (IA-8) are placed by the content work, inside the existing sections when they fit (a Tailwind recommendation under Getting started) and as a new section otherwise. Safe because: the user asked for them without fixing their place, and the navigation is derived from folders, so moving a page costs nothing.
- ASSUMPTION-2: A not-found page (IA-19, SCREEN-5's not-found state) exists because the static host serves one for unknown paths. Safe because: every static host does, and the PRD's fully prerendered constraint implies a static 404; its content is decided in design-ui.
- ASSUMPTION-3: The version switch control (IA-11) is designed in P-1 with the shell so that P-2 does not change the header, even though F-6 ships in R-2. Safe because: the roadmap orders F-6 right after R-1 and the control's slot costs nothing while it shows one version.

## Open questions

- OPEN-1: Does the documentation index (IA-9, `/docs`) exist as its own page, or does `/docs` redirect to the first page (installation)? Blocks: SCREEN-5's index state. Recommended: its own page listing sections and pages, because the failed version switch needs a landing target that names the version and the notice, and an index doubles as that target.
- OPEN-2 (resolved 2026-09-23): the search entry point is an icon in the header on narrow screens (user). Blocks: nothing. Recommended: as decided.

## Readiness

- Ready for design-system and design-ui: yes: SCREEN-3 (shell) first, because every other screen embeds it; then SCREEN-2, then SCREEN-1 after the messaging step; OPEN-1 blocks only SCREEN-5's index state.
